# Fueled by a Hostile Sun

By Gabriel Relich, [The Martian Muckraker](https://muckraker.itch.io/)

 

**The System in a Nutshell:** 

1. Stats are tested on a **d20 roll-under system**.
2. Every stat, in addition to allowing you to do actions, is connected to **mining a resource**. 
3. These resources are represented as **Resource Currencies.**
4. You will be trying to find clues and resources, but every round **Opportunity** might run out. If that happens, you risk losing Stamina on each round.
5. The **Basic Resources** can be used to tame creatures, do Resource Actions, make Elite Resources or make Potions!



#  Building an Explorer

1. **Stats** –Stamina is set by your Archetype. For the remaining six stats (see next page) you can assign 70 points as you see fit. A solid standard array (that adds to 70) is 16, 14, 13, 11, 9 & 7. Ensure no stat is lower than 5 or greater than 16. 
2. **Pick an Archetype** – Your archetype determines how many recipes you can know, what dangers you are best at resisting, your stamina, movement and what pets/bots you can have. 



 

## Explorer Stats and their Uses

·     **Might** - most physical tasks, Mines **Odd Ore [OO]**

·     **Agility** - for dodging, acrobatics and the like, Mines **Arcane Algae [AA]**

·     **Focus** - to keep cool in intense situations, investigate, and resist mind effects, mines **Strange Sap [SS]**

·     **Tech** - interpret technology / evidence, mines **Molten Minerals [MM]**)**,** 

·     **Compassion** - to befriend alien creatures w/ compassion, diplomacy, mines **Helpful Herbs [HH]**) 

·     **Dominance -** to tame w/ dominance or to intimidate. Some creatures respond to compassion, some respond to dominance. Used to **Reist Death.**

 

**Rolling your stat or under is a success.**  If a circumstance gives you **Reinforcement** you can roll twice and take the better result, provided your first roll was not a 20. (Then you always fail)

## Standard Resists

You can negate certain effects using one of three Resists – **Elemental Resists**, **Pest Resists** and **Disease Resists**. 

These Resists are Stats set by your Archetype. 

Rolling your stat or under is a success. Hostile Environment descriptions will state what resist is needed to negate a certain effect.

## Stamina and Stamina Resists

**Stamina** serves as your “HP.” As you take stamina damage your explorer is getting closer and closer to death. 

When the party runs out of Opportunity, you will take 1d6 stamina damage a round, unless you pass a **Stamina Resist**, rolling your current Stamina or lower on a d20.

## Medicine Rolls

You can spend 2 HH to make a **medicine roll** against compassion. Most characters heal 1d2 stamina on a fail and 1d6 stamina on a success. 

**Remember, even on a failed Medicine Roll you still heal 1d2 Stamina!**

If you run out of Stamina, each round you must successfully test Dominance, or die, until a teammate heals you.



 

## Archetype Table Terms

·     **Recp** The max number of alchemy recipes your character can know how to make. 

o  Players can each start knowing 1 or 2 recipes and learn more over the course of play. 

·     **Resists** –**Disease Resist (DR)**, **Elemental Resist (ER)** and **Pest Resist (PR).** Rolling the stat or lower negates bad effect.

·     **Stm** – starting Stamina. 

·     **Pet Stat**: Determines the max number of pets you can own.

·     **Bot Stat:** Determines the max number bots or inventions you can own.

·     **Mov** – how many squares you can move in one round whilst in a hostile environment.

o  Values in ( ) are bonus movement points that can be spent for extra movement. They recharge between hostile environment scenes.

##  

The blue boxes describe the abilities of the archetype. If there is a resource cost in parentheses, that cost must be paid from the party’s stores to do the move. 

## Leveling

The party can spend 20 Evidence Points to rise to Level 2. An additional 40 EP raises the party to Level 3.

**Steed:** Describe your ridable steed. If you are with your steed, you can spend **Mobility** points from the parentheses for extra movement (one point per square). These extra move points recharge between Hostile Environments. Your rideable pet does **not** count against your pet total. 

You are not impacted by **Difficult Terrain**. Also pick one of the following: able to **Walk on Lava**, able to **Swim and Provide O2** to tamer indefinitely, a **Climbing Speed of 3**, **Long Jump** of 20 Feet (forward or vertically).

**Living Shelter (2 OO):** You move up to 3 players (including yourself) into a shelter constructed of Odd Ore plating and your beast, which uses itself as a protective barrier. While in this shelter players automatically pass Elemental Resists. The shelter last 3 turns or until the Beast Rider and Beast move. 

**Due to their need to tame creatures a high Compassion or Dominance is vital for Beast Riders.

**Favored Resource: Chemists are also allowed to pick a Favored Resource.** The chemist has bonus slots for recipes, related to the favored resource. When determining how much of their favored resource they get after a successful mine check, they roll twice and take the larger result.

**Electron Shift (1 MM):** Twice per day, the Chemistry Professor can mine Molten Minerals from an Odd Ore Deposit (or vice-versa) OR mine Strange Sap from an Arcane Algae deposit (or vice versa).

**Lab:** Chemists do not need to pay blockchain to invent recipes

**A high Focus may help a Chemist find clues that lead to narrative-specific recipes. Some Chemists may want to have a high stat for mining their favored resource.

**Might Taming:** When taming creatures, always roll against your Might. If the species in question is a Dominant species, increase your Might stat for this check by 1. 

**Mighty:** Twice per day, you can choose to automatically succeed on a Might roll by **Overclocking** your suit.   

**Alpha:** Even if a Pet is not with you, you can tame creatures marked with a ❗(see *Tamable Creatures*).

**Living Shelter (2 OO):** You move up to 4 players (though you yourself cannot be one of them) into a shelter constructed of Odd Ore plating and your robotic suit,, which you use as a protective barrier. While in this shelter players automatically pass Elemental Resists. The shelter last 3 turns or until You move.

**This variant of the Beast Rider depends on Might, rather than Compassion or Dominance for taming creatures. Thus, a high Might is necessary.**

## Smuggler (alt. Roboticist)

|               | **Recp**  | **Stm**     | **DR**        | **ER**        | **PR**        | **Mov**    |

**Contraband Drone (1 MM OR 1 OO):** You charge your drone and send it to explore. It has a movement of 10 spaces and can radio you visual, thermal and radioactive data. 

**Dirty Money:** Smuggler at start of each game session gains 1d3+1 of a chosen Basic Resource Currency.

**Hacker:** When hacking through a security system you can roll twice and take the better result.

**Street Smarts:** If encountering a wild bot instead of Tech, Dominance will be used to tame. Once per day when taming a wild bot with dominance you can auto succeed on one of the rolls.

 

**This use of Dominance for taming is what separates the Smuggler from the standard Roboticist. As such, a high score should be allotted to Dominance.**

# Hostile Environments

When in a **hostile environment** the PCs must remain in their spacesuits and the game is played in rounds. 

## Opportunity

Should the party run out of **opportunity** conditions escalate in the environment beyond the limits of their suit. An explorer’s suit will (barely) keep them alive, but they will need to do a **Stamina Resist** each round. Should they fail to roll their current Stamina or less on a d20, they will take damage.

## Elevated Impact

In a Hostile Environment some squares are more dangerous than others, these highly impacted areas are considered to have **Elevated Impact.**

## Hostile Environment Round - Summary

**1.**    **Player Turns**

a.    **Impacts Phase:** Role to resist environment

b.   **Hero Phase:** Take actions

2. **Galactic Master Phase**

a.    **The Spread Phase:** GM sees if more squares receive Elevated Impact

**b.**   **Move Pest Swarms**

**3.**    **End of Round**

**a.**   **Determine Stress**

**b.**   **Roll the Opportunity Die**

**c.**    **Failing Space Suits**



 

## Hostile Environment Round - Detail

### Player Turns

**a.**   **Impacts** **Phase** - Players to roll to resist environmental effects. Risk is higher in squares with **elevated impact.** 

**b.**   **Hero Phase –** Each player can move and take an action if they successfully test (roll under) the appropriate stat. 

### Galactic Master Phase

a.    **The Spread** **Phase**–The GM rolls on a **situation specific table** (see *Galactic Master’s Guide*) to determine which squares are **Elevated Impact**. 

**b.**   **Move Pest Swarms** – pests have a Move stat. If they occupy a players square that player must roll pest Resist or take damage (generally 1d6 or 1d8)

### End of Round

**a.**   **Determine Stress** See next page. A player’s status as *Stressed* or not stays the same until this phase the next round.

**b.**   **Opportunity Die Phase** - The players run out of opportunity if, during the **opportunity roll,** the GM rolls a **one**. The size of the opportunity die depends on what **risk level** the environment is, and what round it is. GMs can use p24 to see what to roll. 

**c.**    **Failing Space Suits** – If Opportunity runs out, on that round and then on each round thereafter all players must test Stamina or lose 1d6 stamina points normally, or 1d8 stamina points while *stressed*. 

The goal of being in a hostile environment is usually to find something, often a **quest objective**, **resources**, a **lifeform**, or **evidence points**. Often players will have to weigh risk vs reward. 

## Leaving

The GM will designate specific areas of the map that allow the players to escape to a safer area, leaving the scene.

## Stress

A player becomes **Stressed** if they have 3 stress points. 

**Stressed**: Player must add +3 to all d20 rolls (a disadvantage) while Stressed. Furthermore, during the Failing Spacesuits Phase, they risk losing 1d8 damage, not 1d6 damage, if they fail their Stamina Resist. 

Below are the condition names, what causes the player to have them, and the amount of stress they give while active:

·     **Alone** – cannot see any other party members, and thus cannot be beamed party resources – **1 Stress**

·     **Pestered** – Pests occupy your square. – **1 Stress**

·     **With Wildlife** – Is within 3 spaces of a creature or bot the character does not have the ability to tame – **1 Stress**

·     **In Poor Health** – has less than half their Stamina – **2 Stress**

·     **Impacted** – In an area with Elevated Impact. – **2 Stress**

##  

## Pest Swarms

Pests can roam the environment. They can, depending on species, move 2-8 spaces a turn (depending on species). If they get to your space, you will need to roll Pest Resist or take damage.

On your turn, you can use the *Smash Bug* Stat Move to eliminate a swarm.

**Bile Beatles** – 5 Spaces/turn – d6 damage

**Crater Fleas** – 4 Spaces/Turn – d4 damage

**Radioactive Rats** – 6 Spaces/Turn – d6 damage

**Moon Mason Larvae** – 7 spaces/turn - d4 damage

# Playter Turns and Actions

## Actions

You may, before or after moving, take **one action** on your turn.

**You can propose any action to the GM**. 

Generally, Actions will be determined to fall into one of three types. **Overwatch Actions**, **Resource Actions**, or **Stat Actions**. Overwatch Actions and Resource Actions are predefined moves. 

**Stat Actions can be any action,** though some common ones are ahead. 

## Overwatch Actions

These cost one of your turn actions, but do not require a dice roll or spending any resources. They are always available to you.

·     **Analyze Environment** – You use your scientific expertise to analyze the environment. You have the GM roll the round’s **Opportunity Die** at the time you do this action. *The die does not take effect until the end of the round, as normal*. But knowing the result can now help players make decisions. 

·     **Look for Danger** – GM reveals any environmental traps to you within a number of spaces equal to [Your Focus] – 10. (Minimum of 1)

·     **Please Don’t Die** – Target adjacent player automatically passes this rounds Death Resist. 

·     **Reinforce Player** – Provide aid to another. Adjacent player has Reinforcement on any one roll.



 

## Resource Actions

These do not require a dice roll, but they do spend an action and some resources.

**💡 – Wide player creativity** encouraged, but GM has final choice on what is allowed.

🏃 **– Movement Ability** costs more per space.

·     **Anti-Pest Projectile** – Blast a Pest swarm, protecting it from moving – *Cost: 1 MM or 1 OO* 

·     **💡 Control Water** – Cause a small amount of water to move as you see fit – *Cost: 3 AA* 

·     **💡 Build Simple Device** – Create a simple device and use it, such as levers, tools, ladders etc. – *Cost: 2 OO*

·     🏃 **Extra Movement –** Burn Sap to move extra – *Cost: 1 SS per extra movement space* 

·     **Life Support** **Beam** – Prevent someone who you can see, up to 3 spaces away from dying (E.g. an auto-success on their Death Resist) – *Cost: 1 HH*

o  (full Medicine Checks require 3 HH and that you be adjacent to the person being healed)

·     **Recharge Support System –** Take no actions but any damage you would take until next turn is halved – *Cost 1 SS or 1 AA*

·     **💡 Shape Plant –** Reshape a plant, potentially creating bridges, breaking walls with roots, etc. – *Cost: 3 SS*

·     🏃 **Swim** – Normally spacesuits can’t go into liquid, to move in Water, Arcane Algae must boot to seal – *Cost 1 AA per space*

·     **💡 Use Explosives** – Create a simple explosive or pyrotechnic device and use it. – *Cost: 2 MM*



 

## Stat Actions

Most actions will require you to test the Stat most related to the action.  

**You can propose any action to the GM**. If it seems like no chance of failure is involved in the action, the GM will not require a dice roll. 

If a chance of failure seems possible, the GM will have you test the Stat most closely required to the action. 

**Rolling the stat or under on a d20 is a success.** 

Some common actions you can do by testing Stats are on the table ahead. 

Actions marked with a magnifying glass can produced **Evidence Points**

# Risk Levels and Losing Opportunity



The Risk Level and round number determines the size of the **opportunity die.**

The player’s suits **start to fail** if a 1 is rolled. If so, the players must test Stamina to avoid taking d6 damage to stamina each round. If they are **Stressed** they lose 1d8 Stamina when they fail.

# Resource Currencies & Wealth

**Game currencies allow us to abstract the amounts of resources the characters have.** There are probably thousands of medically useful herbs to be found in the galaxy. The overall state of the stores of the group is abstracted into the game currency “Helpful Herbs.”

## The Basic Resource Currencies

The **Basic Resource Currencie**s, Odd Ore, Arcane Algae, Strange Sap, Molten Minerals and Helpful Herbs are the key to this system. Most game mechanics will connect to these resources in some way. 

## Mining Base Resource Currencies

To mine, a player must first find a **deposit** of the desired resource, generally during a hostile environment scene. 

Each of the Basic Resources is paired with a specific stat. 

**When on or adjacent to a square with a resource deposit, players can spend an action to mine.**  

Players can mine 1d4 of a Geological (Odd Ore or Molten Minerals) on a success. They can mine 1d6 of the other resources on a success. 

| **Mined  Resource (Stat)**       | **Amount Mined on Success** | **Res. Type** | **Element Resource Based On** |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Odd Ore (Might)**              | 1d4                         | Geological    | Metal                         |
| **Molten Minerals**   **(Tech)** | 1d4                         | Geological    | Fire                          |
| **Arcane Algae (Agility)**       | 1d6                         | Botanical     | Water                         |
| **Strange Sap (Focus)**          | 1d6                         | Botanical     | Wood                          |
| **Helpful Herbs (Compassion)**   | 1d6                         | Medicinal     | Earth                         |

 

## Beam Technology

Beam technology allows party members **who see each other** to share resources, even if they are not adjacent.

## Blockchain (Wealth)

NPCs may pay characters in the faster-than-light currency **Blockchain.** 

It costs 2 Blockchain to invent a potion recipe (see the next chapter on Alchemy), unless there are narrative factors that allow the players to create for free.

 



# Alchemy

In *Hostile Sun* a small set of charts allows potions to be *homebrewed*. This system is intended to allow the players to make most anything, whilst having reasonable guardrails. 

·     To determine a **base price** the player / GM first determines what the **narrative effect** of the alchemical potion is (Table 1A)

·     Player and GM then agree on what **game-mechanical impact** (Table 1B) the potion would have. Depending on which game mechanic is chosen you will need to add some resources to your base price. 

Each archetype can learn a different number of recipes. 

## Key Terms

**Base Price:** All potions have a Base Price

**Main Ingredient(MI):** One ingredient type in the Base Price is designated the Main Ingredient.  Some recipes will require you to pay an additional unit of the Main Ingredient

**Purification Ingredient (PI):** A cataylyst is added for some recipes.

**Stat Ingredient (SI):** The ingredient that is mined by the Stat being assisted with the potion.

## Alchemy Table 1A: Narrative Effect 



**In terms of the story’s narrative, how does your potion work?** 

| **Narrative  Effect**                     | **Base**  **Price** | **Main  Ing. (MI)** | **Purification**  **Ingredient.  (PI)** | **Explanation**                                              |

## Alchemy Table 1B: Game Mechanics



Now that we know what your potion does narratively, how do we define its effect in game mechanics? *(Fill in [MI/PI] from table 1A)*

| **Game  Effect**                                             | **Price**                                               | **Uses**            | **Explanation**                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Instant:** It does one GM-negotiated effect  automatically. | **[Base  Price] + [1 MI]**                              | 1                   | Wide leeway as to what potion  does, but can be used only once. Effect must be GM approved. |
| **Action Assist:** I [The potion user only]  can reroll when I use [stat] for [situation] | **[Base Price] + [1 Stat Ing.]** + [**1 PI]**           | 3                   | When you use potion to do the  action with [stat] you have reinforcement.   **Stat Ing:** Add +1 of the resource that is  mined / associated with the [stat] (Might for OO, Agility for AA, etc.  etc.) |
| **Area Effect:** We [anyone in effect area]  can reroll when they use [stat] for [situation] | **[Base Price]** **+ [1 Stat Ingredient] + [2 \*  PI]** | Any,  over 2 rounds | As above, but anyone can benefit  from reroll if they are in impacted area.   **Stat Ing:** As above |
| **Resistance Instant:**  I can reroll [resist] in  [situation]. | **[Base Price]** + **1 HH + [1 MI]**                    | 3                   | For potions that allow you to  reattempt a resist roll.      |

##  



 

## Homebrewing Examples

**Example 1:** Rex needs to drive the ship through a meter belt to get the party where they want to go. He decides to brew a potion that will hyper-focus his reflexes. The GM rules that this is a **Psychological Effect** and the player & GM both agree that the potion should work as an **Action Assist Potion**. 

The formula for an Action Assist Potion is [Base Price] + [Purification Price] + [Special]. 

For a Psychological potion this works out to 2 AA (Base Price) + 1 MM (Enhance Price) + 1 AA (as Agility is what is being used to Dodge, and Agility mines Arcane Algae, AA is what fulfills the special). 

**Thus the final recipe: 3 AA + 1 MM**

 

**Example 2:** Philomena wants to make a potion that will produce a large smoke screen that will drive off all alien creatures in an area. She only needs to use it once so she and the GM agree to make it an **Instant** (Table 2) **Pyrotechnic** (Table 1) potion. The recipe for an instant is [Base Price] + 1 more of the main ingredient. This works out to 3 MM in this case. 

Additional Example Potions, can be found in the Galactic Master’s Guide! 

# Alien Creatures



## Taming

Many lifeforms encountered in a hostile environment are **tamable.**  To tame a creature, the party will need to :

(1) give a **species-specific resource gift** and 

(2) depending on the species’ **social pattern** use Compassion, Dominance, or Tech (for bots) to tame (one action, 3 rolls, 2 of which must be successes).  

Attempting to tame is a single action, but the gift is consumed even on fail. 

##  

## Don’t Let the Zoo Get Too Big!

**Furthermore,** you must not go over the number of pets you are allowed to own at one time, as set by your archetype’s pet/bot stat. 

**Pets bond to the party member who tamed them and cannot be transferred.** They can, however, be returned to the wild, now stronger for the new skills they have learned. 



 

## What Can Creatures Do?

1. Most lifeforms **grant a buff or buffs** to its owner when they are with them. 
2. Some lifeforms, if left in camp, can spend a day to **produce Mithril/Mutagen/M. Elixir** which are important for longer campaigns. (And discussed in the *Galactic Master’s Guide*)

3. Some creatures **provide a stat pool** that their owner can draw on. One stat point can be spent to reroll a die roll made with that stat. 

**Example:** Say Gary has a Might of 13 and needs to clear some rubble. His pet, an Iron Serpent, has a Might Stat Pool of 2. Gary rolls a 15, which would normally be a failure. If succeeding is important enough to him, he can spend those 1 of those 2 points to reroll. 

Each creature description states what resource currencies (and what amount) it can use as food. Paying that amount of the food resource refreshes the stat pool. 



 

# Tamable Creatures Charts

Charts of resource producing creatures follow.  The left-hand side shows what stats creatures of that type tend to have pools in. Number of points in pools tends to be roughly equal to the number of resources spent to tame/feed. (GM can vary how the points are allocated between different members of the same species.) 

**Elite Pets:** Creatures with a ❗can only be tamed if you have an already tamed pet with you. Furthermore, these pets count as two pets against your Pet Stat.

## Creature Abilities

**Stat Pools –** Spend one point for the creature to aid Tamer with a check with that stat. Tamer rolls against their stat twice and takes the better result. OR spend 2 points to auto succeed.

**Barrier** – If tamer is near creature, any projectile effects have a 50% chance to not effect the tamer

**Bust** – can spend a Might point to break down a wall or barrier

**Climb** (Speed) – as ride, but works are vertical surfaces

**Comforting** – You cannot gain stress from the *Alone* condition with this pet

**Fly** (Speed) – as ride, but works in the air / allows gaps to be flown over

**Jump** (Speed) – as fly but must land after movement

**Pest Bane [stat]** – Pests flee the pet if they roll this stat or lower

**Ride** (speed) – Spend one Stat point (any) to allow tamer to ride the beast at that speed for 3 turns

**Support-[Type]-[Number]** – All players when using the Resist (Elemental/Pest/Disease) in [type] have reinforcement if they are within [number of spaces] of creature

**Swim** (Speed) – as Ride, but in water. When on a Creature that can *Swim* you do not need to pay Arcane Algae to move in water.

# Diplomatic Interactions (Optional)

Diplomatic Keywords serve a similar role as “alignment” in traditional RPGs.

Each player will choose one **keyword** from each set below. 

**Peasant**  /  **Merchant**  /  **Criminal**  /  **Noble**

**Traditionalist**  /  **Autonomist**

**Private**  /  **Moderate**  /  **Spotlight**

**Compassionate / Dominant / Balanced** (balanced can be picked if Compassion and Dominance are equal or no more than 1 point different)

The future world has regressed to a very class-divided society.  These keywords reflect where your character falls in the class divides of society. 

When designing NPCs, the GM will note what **keywords** the NPC is biased in favor of, and which against. If pro-biases outnumber anti-biases, it will be easier to negotiate with the NPC. If the reverse, the NPC may only be amendable with a bribe or with a successful Compassion / Dominance roll. 



 

# Dedication

“Fantasy can, of course, be carried to excess. It can be ill done. It can be put to evil uses. It may even delude the minds out of which it came. But of what human thing in this fallen world is that not true? Men have conceived not only of elves, but they have imagined gods, and worshipped them, even worshipped those most deformed by their authors' own evil. But they have made false gods out of other materials: their notions, their banners, their monies; even their sciences and their social and economic theories have demanded human sacrifice. *Abusus non tollit usum.* **Fantasy remains a human right: we make in our measure and in our derivative mode, because we are made: and not only made, but made in the image and likeness of a Maker.” -** C.S. Lewis

**To C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien who understood what good and true fantasy was for and how it could illuminate us.** 

 

May we never forget.
