# Readme

The settlement’s life support is at the brink.  A solution to this world’s dangerous conditions must be devised & corruption amongst the station leaders must be investigated. But the Void of Space was not meant for Man. These planets are not “Mother” like Earth – you are under a hostile sun.

1. A rules-lite exploration-focused RPG.  There is no combat system - rather the enemy is the brutal environment you are trying to survive in.
2. Rules light but exciting system for Environmental Encounters that encourages risk vs reward decisions.
3. Currency system that allows easy tracking of resources mined from the planet.   Find alien creatures to produce even rarer resources - maybe even the Prime Matter- unlimited potential- itself.  
4. Character Sheets fit on one index card.
5. ORC Licensed
